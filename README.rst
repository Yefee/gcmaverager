### About GCMAverager
GCMAverger is a lightweight parallel post process package designed for large amount GCM outputs.
It was originally designed to post process a long run from the community earth system model (CESM), who genreated hundreds of TBs data.
NCAR has developed two fancy tools: pyAverager and pyReshaper, however, they are not easy to use and maintain. More importantly,

GCMAverager primarily can 
* extract variables from time slice history files into time seris files;
* compute annual (decadal) and seasonal mean for model outputs. 
GCMAverager is based on xarray, a project ###
